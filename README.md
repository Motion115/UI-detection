# UI-detection

### Dependencies

A requirement.txt will be ramped up in future updates.

Some key dependencies include torch(2.0.0+cu117), torchvision(0.15.1), tqdm, and numpy.

### Dataset

[Enrico](https://github.com/luileito/enrico) dataset is intended to be used in this project.

To access the data, there are two potential ways of aquiring the data. You can attempt to download the data from the [enrico repository](https://github.com/luileito/enrico). Alternatively, if you are using Linux or WSL, you can access the dataset by using the **download_data.sh** in enrico_utils folder. The enrico_utils folder contains a very small subset of the [MultiBench](https://github.com/pliang279/MultiBench) toolkit, which stands for Multiscale Benchmarks for Multimodal Representation Learning. Check out its dedicated repo for more details.
